I am a second-year engineering student at L’École Centrale Méditerranée, France, interested in artificial intelligence. I have solid programming experience in Python, C++, and Java. Outside of academics, I enjoy climbing, running, and playing the piano. Always open to new opportunities and connections in the AI and engineering communities.
